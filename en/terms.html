        </p>

        <p>
        (4) The customers are authorized to acquire and use the Internet services and software made available under
        www.pluck-n-play.com in accordance with the following provisions.
        </p>

        <h2>&sect; 2 Offers, Conclusion of a Contract, Performance and Delivery Obligations</h2>

        <p>
        (1) Offers on the Internet portal www.pluck-n-play.com are without engagement, unless otherwise
        specifically agreed as binding. Orders are only considered to be firm if acknowledged by

        </p>

        <p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <h2>&sect; 3 Right of Revocation; Consumer Information; Information on E-Commerce</h2>

        <div class="emphasize">
            <p>
            (1) According to "Deutsches B&#252;rgerliches Gesetzbuch" (German Civil Code)
            (&sect;&sect; 355 ff. BGB), Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR grants
            customers the right of revocation in a transaction of distance selling.
            </p>

            <p>
            (2) The two-week revocation period begins at the earliest on the day after receipt of the activation
            key required for activating the full version of the software, provided that the customer has been
            informed about his rights by means of the consumer information.
            </p>

            <p>
            (3) The revocation can be made without restrictions or statement of reasons in written form
            (e.g. letter, fax, email). To meet the deadline, it is sufficient to dispatch the declaration
            of revocation within a period of 14 days.
            </p>

            <p>
            (4) The declaration of revocation is to be sent to:
            </p>

            <p id="revocation_address">
                Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR<br/>
                Franz-Gresitza-Str. 64<br/>
                07749 Jena<br/>
                Germany<br/>
                Fax: +49 (0) 3631 - 358536<br/>
                Email: contact@pluck-n-play.com<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
            (5) The right of revocation expires for software made available for downloading on the date this
            software is activated online (&sect; 4.3).
            </p>

            <p>
            (6) On timely receipt of the revocation, Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR is obliged to reimburse
            the customer for the payments made.
            </p>

            <p>
            (7) The right of revocation is not applicable to tradesmen. The right of revocation according to
            "Deutsches B&#252;rgerliches Gesetzbuch" (German Civil Code) is therefore ineffective.
            </p>

            <p>
            (8) The customer can download these General Terms and Conditions in printable form as a file
            at any time from the portal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>&sect; 4 Subject and Form of Delivery</h2>

        <p>
        (1) The customer receives the software subject to the contract in executable form (object code) along with
        the corresponding documentation released by the supplier.
        </p>

        <p>
        (2) The software provides the functionality specified in the documentation. This document on the functionality
        can already be read, printed and downloaded by the customer prior to the conclusion of the contract from the
        portal in the context of the product specification.
        </p>

        <div class="emphasize">
            <p>
            (3) Delivery is made by transfer of an activation key to the delivery e-mail address stated in the order
            form. After the download has been accomplished the software must be activated online, which is only
            possible if a link to the Internet is available.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>

        (2) The customer is entitled to use one "copy" of the software at maximally one (1) computer/work place.
        </p>

        <p>
        (3) Any use beyond the contractually agreed level, in particular the use of the software on more than
        one computer per acquired copy of software, is a breach of contract.
        </p>

        <p>
        (4) The customer is entitled to make a safety copy of the software and to conduct everyday backups;
        further copies are not to be made.
        </p>

        <div class="emphasize">
            <p>
            (5) To guarantee and protect the contractual use of the software an online activation per computer/work
            place must be conducted and, thus, a link to the Internet is a compulsory pre-condition.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        (6) The customer must not decompile, change or otherwise process the software, unless specifically

        and/or any backup copies, nor shall he/she make these available for third parties in any other form.
        Also excluded is the reproduction of the programme, either wholly or in part, for the purpose of
        simultaneous multiple use on several computer systems. All resulting claims against the purchaser,
        in particular copyright claims and claims for damages, shall remain unaffected. The aforesaid actions
        may resultin criminal liability and this fact is explicitly indicated.
        </p>

        <p>
        (8) Notes on copyright and other property rights within the software are neither to be deleted nor changed.
        They must be transferred to every copy of the software.
        </p>

        <h2>&sect; 6 Prices; Terms of Payment and Billing</h2>

        <p>
        (1) All listed prices are final prices. Due to Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR's status as
        a small business in accordance with &sect;19 UstG (German Value Added Tax Act), we do not charge VAT.
        </p>

        <p>
        (2) The supplier is entitled to pass on the received data to a third party as far as this is required to

        </p>

        <p>
        (4) The supplier maintains the rights to the subject matter of this agreement until payment is fully made.
        The supplier is in particular entitled to forbid the use of the software, if he withdraws from the contract
        as a consequence of the customer's default on payments, for instance. Should a third party gain access to
        the reserved property prior to full payment of the contractual software, the customer is obliged to inform
        this third party about the supplier's reservation and immediately inform the supplier in writing of the
        third party's access.
        </p>

        <h2>&sect; 7 Warranty; Exclusion of Liability</h2>

        <p>
        (1) In the case of quality claims the warranty is, at the option of Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR, limited to
        replacement deliveries or subsequent repair. Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR disclaims any express or implied
        warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability. Releasing a new version of software
        by Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR does not constitute a defect of the previously sold software.
        </p>

        <p>
        (2) If repairs or replacement deliveries fail within an appropriate period of time, the customer has
        the choice to claim a reduction of the purchase price or to withdraw from the contract. The specified
        time will not be less than four weeks. Repairs or replacement deliveries are to be considered as
        unsuccessful if three attempts to correct the quality claims have failed.
        </p>

        <p>
        (3) Notice of apparent defects or transparent damages must be given in writing to Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR
        within 2 months from receipt of the goods. If no quality complaint is lodged within the specified period
        of time after receipt of the shipment, the goods are considered to be accepted by the customer and all
        warranty claims are barred. In order to give timely notice, timely dispatch of the notice is sufficient;
        the burden of proof lies with the customer. Tradesmen must check quality and completeness of the goods
        immediately after their receipt and must notify Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR of discovered defects without delay.
        The goods delivered are considered to be accepted if a tradesman fails to inspect the goods received
        and notify Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR about any defects within the specified time, unless the defect was
        concealed at the inspection. Notice of a defect found at a later date must also be given to
        Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR without delay. Otherwise these defective goods will be considered as accepted.
        The notification of quality complaints must be effected in writing and the defects must be described
        in detail. Moreover, &sect;&sect; 377 f. HGB (German Commercial Code) apply correspondingly.
        </p>

        <p>
        (4) The warranty does not cover defects if the goods are improperly treated, used, or modified.
        The warranty is inapplicable if the customer or a third party installs the contractual goods improperly
        or if maintains them on their own, repair, modify or expose them to a working environment which is not
        compatible the stated requirements for installation.
        </p>

        <p>
        (5) Claims of a customer for indemnification on the grounds of non fulfillment, faulty contract conclusion,
        breach of agreed collateral obligations, consequential damages from defects, damages resulting from
        unauthorized actions and other legal grounds are excluded, provided that Mei&#223;ner &amp; Mei&#223;ner GbR is liable
        for failing to provide guaranteed properties, for wilful action or for gross negligence. This exclusion
        does not apply to claims according to the German product liability law (German Produkthaftungsgesetz).
        </p>

        <p>
        (6) The warranty period is 12 months from delivery. For the purchase of consumer goods by End Users,
        the warranty period is extended to 24 months.
        </p>

        <h2>&sect; 8 Data Protection and Confidentiality</h2>

        <p>
        All personal data obtained will be treated confidentially. The data required for business transactions
        will be stored and will only be transmitted to associated companies and sub-suppliers for the purpose
        of processing the orders.
        </p>
